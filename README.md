# krea2edit trainer — ai-toolkit extension

*Community project — not affiliated with or endorsed by Krea.ai. "Krea" is used
descriptively to identify the base model this trainer targets.*

☕ **[Support on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/conradlocke)** — all tips go straight to GPU
compute for future versions.

This is the actual training code behind the released
[krea2-identity-edit](https://huggingface.co/conradlocke/krea2-identity-edit) LoRAs —
not a reimplementation. Its reference geometry is geometry-matched to the
[comfyui-krea2edit](https://github.com/lbouaraba/comfyui-krea2edit) inference nodes
(v1.2.4+), so what you train is what the nodes run. "Geometry-matched" is exact about
the things that misregister — fit dimensions, crop rectangles, and the centered
fractional RoPE offsets are identical — but the two stacks do *not* use the same
resample kernel (this trainer resizes references with bilinear + antialias, the node
with bicubic + antialias), so reference pixels differ slightly below the geometry.

It adds one model architecture to [ai-toolkit](https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit):

- `krea2_edit` — instruction-based, reference-conditioned editing (the identity-edit
  recipe): in-context reference tokens + image-grounded text conditioning

(Plain Krea 2 text-to-image training is already built into upstream ai-toolkit as
`arch: "krea2"` — this extension doesn't duplicate it.)

**Note on upstream's own edit mode:** ai-toolkit's built-in `krea2` arch also offers
an edit mode (`model_kwargs: {edit: true}`). It is a *different training contract* —
a "Picture N:"-labeled grounding template and an area-budget reference resize —
whereas this extension implements the exact grounding template and fit-to-target-grid
reference geometry that the comfyui-krea2edit nodes (and the released
krea2-identity-edit LoRAs) use. Both are valid trainers; they are not interchangeable.
If you want LoRAs that pair with the identity-edit inference stack, train with
`arch: "krea2_edit"` from this extension.

## Install

```bash
cd ai-toolkit/extensions
git clone https://github.com/lbouaraba/krea2edit-trainer krea2_edit
```

That's it — ai-toolkit discovers extensions in that folder. Set `arch: "krea2_edit"`
in your config.

## Model access

Krea 2 RAW weights are gated: accept the license at
[krea/Krea-2-Raw](https://huggingface.co/krea/Krea-2-Raw), then point
`model.name_or_path` at the single-file `.safetensors` checkpoint (or a folder
containing one — the sharded diffusers layout is not supported). Setting it to the
repo id `krea/Krea-2-Raw` also works: the single-file checkpoint is downloaded for
you (set `HF_TOKEN` for the gated repo). Non-default filenames:
`model.model_kwargs.checkpoint_filename`.

## Dataset layout

Standard ai-toolkit paired-image datasets:

```
my_dataset/
  targets/          # edited result images + .txt captions (the edit instruction)
    0001.png
    0001.txt
  sources/          # reference images, stem-matched to targets
    0001.png
  sources_b/        # optional second reference (multi-ref), stem-matched
    0001.png
```

- `folder_path` → `targets/`, `control_path` → `["sources/"]` (add `sources_b/` for
  two-reference training; references appear in the token sequence in list order).
- The caption is the *instruction* ("place her on a beach at sunset"), not a
  description of the target.
- Targets-only datasets (no `control_path`) train as plain T2I through the same arch —
  useful as regularization.
- **`cache_text_embeddings: false` is required** for edit datasets: text conditioning
  is image-grounded and jittered per step (see below), so it must not be cached.
- **`flip_x` / `flip_y` must stay false** on edit datasets: ai-toolkit flips the
  target image but not the raw control (reference) images, so every flipped pair is
  silently desynced. The trainer raises on this when it can see the dataset config;
  pre-flip pairs offline (both images) if you want mirror augmentation.
- **`batch_size: 1`** — raw control images of mixed sizes cannot be collated (see
  "Not supported" below). Use `gradient_accumulation` for a larger effective batch.
- At most **two** `control_path` entries: the inference nodes take `source_image` and
  `source_image_b`, nothing more.

## The recipe, in short

- **Grounded text encoding** — each reference image is fed to the Qwen3-VL text
  encoder alongside the instruction. Grounding resolution is jittered per step for
  scale robustness. **The released LoRAs trained at max 768 / jitter min 384**, which
  is also what this trainer now uses by default (and matches the inference node's
  `grounding_px` default of 768) — no env vars needed:
  ```bash
  python run.py config/your_config.yaml
  ```
  The env vars remain as *optional overrides*, e.g. a higher cap (which is **not**
  what the released weights used, and costs VRAM and step time):
  ```bash
  GROUNDING_MAX_PX=1024 GROUNDING_JITTER_MIN=384 python run.py config/your_config.yaml
  ```
  `GROUNDING_MAX_PX=0` disables the cap entirely (native-resolution grounding) — off
  the released recipe; the trainer warns when you do it.
- **Fit reference protocol** (`fit` geometry, `model_kwargs: {fit_refs: true}` — the
  default) — references are AR-preserving fitted to the target grid with exact /16
  alignment and fractionally-centered positions. This matches the v1.2.4+ node
  geometry exactly; older reimplementations that floor to /16 or use integer offsets
  produce seam artifacts. `fit_refs: false` opts into the legacy v1/v1.1 crop
  geometry, which then **requires** `fit_mode: "crop (legacy)"` at inference — the
  trainer prints a loud warning when you select it.
- **Weighted flow-matching** — `timestep_type: "weighted"`: uniform timestep sampling
  with a per-timestep loss weight table.
- **Two-stage training works well**: a bulk skill/identity stage at 512, then a short
  finishing pass at 1024 warm-started from the best 512 checkpoint
  (`network.pretrained_lora_path`). Merging nearby checkpoints from the finishing
  stage often beats any single one.
- Rank: useful capacity saturates well below what you might expect — r64–128 is a
  good default; go higher only if you measure a reason to.

### Not supported

These are refused with a clear error rather than silently training a LoRA the
inference nodes cannot reproduce:

- **In-training sample previews** for the edit arch. ai-toolkit's sampling path
  renders the inherited plain-T2I pipeline (no reference tokens, no image-grounded
  text encode), so previews would not show what the LoRA actually does. Use
  `train: { disable_sampling: true }` and evaluate checkpoints in ComfyUI.
- **`batch_size` > 1 with the fit protocol.** ai-toolkit collates raw control images
  with `torch.cat`, which requires every source in a batch to have identical pixel
  dimensions; mixed-size datasets crash mid-run. Use `batch_size: 1` and raise
  `gradient_accumulation` instead.
- **More than 2 references.** The nodes expose exactly two reference inputs
  (`source_image` + `source_image_b`), so at most two `control_path` entries.
- **Flip augmentation with the fit protocol** (`flip_x` / `flip_y` on a dataset).
  ai-toolkit flips the target image but *not* the raw control images, silently
  desyncing every flipped pair. Keep both false, or pre-flip pairs offline (flipping
  target *and* source together, as a separate dataset folder).

## VRAM: measured requirements — read before filing an issue

These are **measured peak CUDA allocations** (fp8-quantized base + fp8 TE, batch 1,
gradient checkpointing, latent caching on, text embeddings NOT cached — i.e. the full
recipe with per-step grounding jitter, everything resident). Your card needs the peak
plus ~1–2 GB driver/display overhead.

| Config | Peak alloc | Fits on |
|---|---:|---|
| r64 @512 | **28.1 GB** | 32 GB cards, comfortably |
| r128 @512 | **32.0 GB** | does NOT fit 32 GB as-is — use 8-bit AdamW (~29 GB) or cached embeddings |
| r64 @768 | **30.9 GB** | 32 GB cards, tight (leave headroom: headless card recommended) |
| r16 @512, full bf16 (no quant) | 42.1 GB | reference worst case |

Field cross-check: independent beta testing on a 32 GB card (r128 @512, uncached)
read 31.3 GB and fell into PCIe offload — matching the table.

**What this means per card:**

- **32 GB**: the sweet spot. r64 @512 uncached runs the full recipe. r128 wants 8-bit
  AdamW or cached embeddings.
- **24 GB**: only with **cached text embeddings** (`cache_text_embeddings: true`),
  which evicts the 4 GB TE and lands ~24 GB — borderline, and caching freezes ONE
  grounding scale, trading away the scale-robustness the jitter provides. A
  multi-scale grounding cache that removes this tradeoff is planned for a follow-up
  release.
- **16 GB**: **not supported today.** Please don't file issues asking why 1024
  training OOMs on 16 GB — the base model alone is 13 GB quantized. The planned
  grounding-cache mode plus aggressive settings may eventually enable 512px here.
- **1024px training**: not a consumer-card recipe. Expect it to exceed 32 GB
  even quantized. The shipped models did the bulk of their training at 512 and used
  1024 only for a short finishing pass — do that pass on rented hardware (an A6000/
  L40S-class 48 GB card or better).

**Troubleshooting install/env issues (found the hard way):**

- Install ai-toolkit's own `requirements.txt` exactly. A stale `diffusers` breaks
  aitk's *built-in* extensions with an opaque `Error running on_error` crash before
  this extension even loads.
- `adamw8bit` requires a bitsandbytes build matching your CUDA; if bnb prints a
  library-load error at startup it is harmless *unless* you selected an 8-bit
  optimizer — then switch to `adamw`.

Example configs are in `configs/`. Values in them (steps, repeats, learning rate)
are **generic starting points** — tune for your dataset.
